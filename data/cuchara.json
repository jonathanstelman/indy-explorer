We are a community-based, nonprofit-operated outdoor recreation area created through grassroots efforts to renew a special area that was left abandoned by the former ski area managers stop operations in 2000. We offer year-round outdoor recreational opportunities with a focus on free and affordable activities that allow anyone, no matter one's background, skill level, or age. Our mission is to ensure no one is denied the benefit of the outdoors and help to ensure our community and economy thrive.",
