    "description": "The Okanagan's best-kept secret. Nestled in the heart of BC, a whopping 1,850 metres above sea level, Nickel Plate has the snow, the terrain, and the views that equal nothing short of a slice of Heaven. With 50'ish km of trails groomed for both Skate and Classic, 25+ km of snowshoe trails, and a community of winter keeners that is second to none, Nickel Plate is your Nordic home away from home.",
