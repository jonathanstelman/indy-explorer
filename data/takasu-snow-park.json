    "description": "Takasu Snow Park, which is next to Dynaland, is the largest snow resort in western Japan, and has a wide variety of courses that can be skied from early December to late April. We get relatively few visitors from overseas and are kind of a hidden gem, so we are applying to let the world know the appeal of this area.",
