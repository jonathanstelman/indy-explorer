    "description": "Eagle Point Resort is where you go to escape the crowds, with no li lines and uncrowded slopes. Nearly all lodging is ski-in/ski-out and literal steps from the trails. At 10,000 feet the Utah powder is dry, fresh and plentiful at over 350 each winter. The lower steep side of the mountain will challenge any skier and never moguls due to the lack of crowds, and the upper side of the resort features perfect uncrowded groomers for beginners and intermediates to turn with confidence. A real throwback--on a powder day you can still score freshies deep into the aernoon, and then chances are you will see the person you rode the li with at the bar and restaurant in the village later on.",
