There are two chairlifts (both triple) and a magic carpet for the beginner area. The average annual snowfall is 500 inches. One of the oldest ski areas in the western U.S., Pomerelle began its operations in 1940. During the ski season, the area operates daily from 9 am - 4 pm and Tuesday through Saturday 9 am - 9 pm. Pomerelle features a spacious lodge at the base of the mountain, offering food and beverages. The Slope Side Grill outside the lodge, on the deck, offers hamburgers, hot dogs and cold drinks. The basement offers restrooms, lockers, a full line of accessories and rentals. Our professional instructors who offer affordable lessons, have earned us the title of Where Idaho Learns to Turn.",
