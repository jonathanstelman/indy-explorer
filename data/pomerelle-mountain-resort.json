Pomerelle features a spacious lodge at the base of the mountain, offering food and beverages. The Slope Side Grill outside the lodge, on the deck, offers hamburgers, hot dogs and cold drinks. The basement offers restrooms, lockers, a full line of accessories and rentals. Our professional instructors who offer affordable lessons, have earned us the title of Where Idaho Learns to Turn.",
