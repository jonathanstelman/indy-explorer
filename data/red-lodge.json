    "description": "Nestled within the Beartooth Mountains, Red Lodge Mountain delivers big mountain fun without the big crowds or big prices. We prize great skiing and great people over glitz and glamour and nowhere is that more evident than in our diverse mix of terrain and friendly staff. But most of all, we believe that on a powder day, you should be free to seek out your own secret stash. Because you shouldn\u2019t have to settle for first tracks when you can enjoy first, second, and third tracks. Red Lodge Mountain is Montana skiing, pure and simple.",
