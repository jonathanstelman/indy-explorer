    "description": "Eaglecrest is not your average community ski area. We have a 1620\u2032 vertical drop, 640+ acres, impressive backcountry access, and hardly a lift line. Powder lasts longer here! There are no roads into Juneau, Alaska\u2014 you have to live here, fly, or ferry to experience this powder paradise. Untracked snow, ridge hikes, and breathtaking views are more common than lift lines. What we lack in luxury, we make up for in charm, solitude, and affordability; there\u2019s no need to rush at Eaglecrest. Fixed-grip double chairlifts bring you up, and the snow is waiting at the top! Adult lift tickets are only $75.",
