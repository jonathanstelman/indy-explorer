    "description": "Not every snowy adventure needs a two-hour drive and a packed lift line. Hoedown Hill brings the best parts of Colorado winter right to Windsor; terrain parks, Ski School, day and night skiing/snowboarding sessions, and tubing. It\u2019s where beginners find their footing, park riders push their limits, and families discover a new winter tradition close to home. Built by locals, for locals, this hill is small on purpose, because it means more runs, more progression, and more time to ride.",
