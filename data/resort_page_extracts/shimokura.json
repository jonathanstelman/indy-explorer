    "description": "Shimokura is a local gem of the Hachimantai powder belt. This protected east-facing bowl gets positively dumped with high-quality super light snow. This small resort consists of just three lifts, but the tree skiing and backcountry options will have you playing on the mountain all day. A lift ticket here can also be used at the beginner-friendly Panorama resort which is connected by a 10-minute shuttle ride and does offer night skiing.",
