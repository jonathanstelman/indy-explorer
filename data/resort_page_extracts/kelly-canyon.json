    "description": "Located in a canyon above the South Fork of the Snake River, just 30 minutes east of Idaho Falls, Kelly Canyon is considered one of the best places in Idaho to learn how to ski. This small family ski area offers varied terrain suitable for both beginners and expert thrill-seekers. Skiers also have access to deep backcountry powder off the top of the hill and miles of ungroomed trails. It's an intermediate mountain with a few harder runs, and a definite family feel. The mountain has undergone significant upgrades and improvements under new ownership in the last 3 years including a new triple lift, new rentals, and updates to the lodge, parking and guest services area.",
