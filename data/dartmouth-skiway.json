    "description": "You don\u2019t come to the Dartmouth Skiway for champagne powder. You don\u2019t come for thousands of feet of continuous vert or high-speed quads or a gourmet, overpriced lunch at the lodge. Those things are great \u2013 and you can find them at a lot of other ski areas across the world. Instead, the Skiway offers something you can only find here: a return to the simple, unvarnished New England ski experience with that quintessential Dartmouth character.",
