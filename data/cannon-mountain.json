    "description": "Cannon Mountain is the highest ski resort in the State of New Hampshire, situated in the heart of Franconia Notch State Park and surrounded by the White Mountain National Forest. Incredible views of the iconic Franconia Ridge can be seen from all over the mountain, which boasts formidable, difficult terrain on and off piste for folks who shred, and gentle, beginner-friendly trails for the novice skier and rider. Cannon Mountain is known for seemingly having its own ecosystem, which yields more variable weather and oftentimes, more snowfall! With a long history steeped in authentic Eastern ski culture, it's no wonder Cannon is known as \"The Living Legend!\"",
