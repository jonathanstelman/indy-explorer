    "description": "Located a dozen miles north of Fairfield in the Sawtooth National Forest lies Soldier Mountain. We have lots of easy trails for beginners and intermediates, but for those seeking something more exciting, there are more advanced machine-cut jump trails for those craving an adrenaline rush. There is something for everyone at Soldier Mountain! The resort\u2019s snowmaking system now extends from the base to the top of Chair 1 for the first time since the late 1970s, ensuring access to Chair 2 earlier in the season. It boasts an impressive snowcat-skiing operation with access to 2,000 acres of backcountry, as well as great hike-to terrain on the front side and excellent side country.",
