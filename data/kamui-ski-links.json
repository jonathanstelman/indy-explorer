    "description": "Kamui Ski Links in Japan offers a budget-friendly ski experience with abundant powder skiing and snowboarding opportunities. Nestled in a location reachable from Asahikawa or Furano, it provides enough terrain for two to three days of enjoyment, featuring 25 courses with about 600 meters of vertical and a mix of groomed/non groomed runs. Off-piste and tree skiing are highlights, easily accessible via lifts. While the gondola can have queues, the resort remains relatively uncrowded, making it a serene destination for powder enthusiasts.",
