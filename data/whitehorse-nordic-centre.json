Explore the snowy scenery of Mount McIntyre, with 93 km of groomed trails for classic and skate enthusiasts and take your best photos with rosy cheeks and frosted eyelashes. Choose your routes across easy, intermediate and difficult terrain and take a break at one (or all) of the 3 warming huts. Weekly family events through the winter. Join us March 8 and 9 for the annual Yukon Ski Marathon 2025 and the Whitehorse Nordic Festival! And best of all, end your ski trip by relaxing in the sauna.
