    "description": "Nestled in the heart of the Mount Washington Valley, Black Mountain has been serving up snow, smiles and memories since 1935. From the Shovel Handle, the first overhead cable lift in the country, to snowmaking on the Whitney slope in 1957, one of the first snowmaking systems in New England, Black\u2019s history is rich with a commitment to its skiers and riders. Today, Black offers skiing and riding for all ages and abilities across over 140 acres, 5 lifts and 45 trails. Updated snowmaking on 98% of terrain and robust grooming make Black a sure bet for quality skiing and riding any day of the season. On a powder day, locals choose Black as the place to be for its manicured glades, summit steeps and non-existent lift lines.",
