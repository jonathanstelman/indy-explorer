    "description": "While the alpine skiing is notably more famous at Mount Washington, the Nordic Centre at Raven Lodge facilities are equally impressive, with its own base lodge offering over 55 kilometers of cross-country skiing, along with snowshoeing and fat biking trails, half of which are in the adjacent Strathcona Park, BC's oldest Provincial Park. In anticipation of the Winter Games that were held in Vancouver in 2010, MWAR upgraded their Nordic facilities to Olympic standards, and many of the teams competing made MWAR their training center leading up to those Olympic Games for cross-country skiing and biathlon. Those same world-class facilities are now enjoyed by Mount Washington\u2019s guests and Season Pass Holders each winter season. Mount Washington Alpine Resort has been a must-visit destination for Vancouver Island snow sports enthusiasts for over 45 years.",
