# Indy Explorer
This is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app that aims to make it just a 
little easier to navigate resorts in the [Indy Pass](https://www.indyskipass.com/) 
product. 

Uses [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to extract resort 
data, and [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding) 
to normalize location data.
  
Data from [indyskipass.com](https://www.indyskipass.com/our-resorts) as of December 14, 2024.
